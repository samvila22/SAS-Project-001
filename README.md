# SAS-Project-001
Midterm project

This project establishes an algorithm that takes data from a gapminder website and translates the datset into a displayable graph. There are 2 built in streams, one for single year inputs and one for a range of year inputs. The output is sent to our designated folder as a .gif file displaying our desired graphs.
